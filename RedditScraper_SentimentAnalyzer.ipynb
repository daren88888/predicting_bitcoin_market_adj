After the first confirmation of the network, they are immediately forwarded to the user's address.\n","\n","Apirone was the first to make a payment forwarding with the application of the SegWit technology! As the destination address, you can indicate any type of bitcoin addresses that exists at the moment: standard addresses starting with \"1\" (P2PKH); Pay to Script Hash addresses with the SegWit support (P2SH-P2WPKH), starting with \"3\"; as well as new SegWit addresses starting with \"bc\" (P2WPKH).\n","\n","Transactions with a SegWit-signature are added to the blocks with a priority, and the network commission is much lower in this case, which, as a result, helps the sender of a transaction to save time and money on sending the payment.\n","\n","By default, the service generates a P2SH-P2WPKH address with the SegWit support for the payments. Both old and modern bitcoin wallets can use such addresses. The service uses exactly this type of address because at the moment only about 20% of net members support the SegWit, and there is an extremely small number of wallets that support the QR-code recognition and effect payments on the native SegWit addresses.\n","\n","As a matter of convenience, Apirone uses a GET-request to confirm a payment. In this case, there are no conflicts with the security policies of different stores or other access problems (for example, restrictions on POST-requests from external resources).\n","\n","And for the security and anonymity geeks the company made the callback to the TOR network possible.\n","\n","The API of the forwarding service is open to all the users and doesn’t require registration.

Nothing in the log seems to have changed at that point. Just slower. MacBook Air Early 2015 (OS 10.13.2 High Sierra).  Changed dbcache=3000 (I have 4GB RAM).  Not enough GB on my computer, so also moved the blocks folder to an external SSD drive (USB 3.0), and symlinked.  Also symlinked the index file back to the computer.  Computer is plugged into ethernet, so no WiFi issues.  Internet speed is 65 Mbps.\n","I feel like I set it up right, or it wouldn't have started?

People, you believe in the crypto-idea without banks controlling money supply, or not?! Bitcoin's unique value add lies in its usecase of STORAGE OF VALUE!! get it already! People what is happening to all the world of Bitcoin? Are we infiltrated by shizophrenia or what?\n","How can you DAYTRADE or Short-term speculate on Bitcoin???  Its like daytrading on the Internet if in the 90's there would be an \"internet\" coin. But after decades, guess what. the internet is STILL HERE!!! When do you get it already that this is a technological change, not some pennystocks game!?  \n","\n","Bitcoin has the unique usecase of being THE only and best STORAGE OF VALUE, FOR LIFE!  Better and more comfortable to store than physical heavy gold or silver!!\n","\n","Just like gold/silver are ONLY value store in the real world next to cash, Bitcoin is the ONLY reasonable one in the digital world (maybe one more Reasonable verium, see below)! But thats it! Just like gold/silver, no more place for others for THIS usecase , value store can only be comprised of max. 2 coins!!\n","\n","So just stop comparing btc to the damn altcoins which one is faster etc. Nobody pays with gold!It is ok not to pay with btc! Just like in the real world nobody pays with gold, but with cash or banktransfers,  in crypto you should just pay with n altcoin that is at one moment more suitable for THAT usecase (and this applies for every other usecases)! \n","\n","There can be thousands of altcoins , with highly innovative new features, but ONLY ONE suitable for the store of value! So trade your awesome altcoins but NEVER misuse btc for short term speculations in general! Store of value means storing=holding. Just get it into your heads already!!\n","\n","Damn panicking people all over the world. What kind of shizophrenia is it to react  on EVERY single news when the ACTUAL usecase of btc is ***LONGTERM VALUE STORE for lifetime***!?\n","\n","Which coin other than btc is giving you 10years stability of transactions hashes history?!?! IF you wanna gamle, moon, and trade and support innovative ideas, look at the ALTCOINS for that!  Promote your favorite alts. But btc has already its place, so no damn speculation and panic reactions like chickens when in comes to bitcoin! No daytrade and sell.offs needed, you harm yourself , we all are for decentralization!  Longterm support is only way to promote new technologies. BTC is for hold and getting \"IN\". Altcoins do the rest.\n","\n","i want anyone who comes accross this thread to remember to think and look cryptos from perspective of USE CASES and to remember one of the most important usecase of value storage.\n","\n","If this usecase wouldnt be so important, you wouldnt have hundreds of central banks fighting about control on physical gold and buying and sitting on it!\n","\n","People have to realize the magnitude of this usecase.\n","\n","And i think many people really do not grasp the idea, because all the time they talk about qquick transactions etc. They got tricked by mainsstream media into putting btc in the same pool as altcoins! but this is illogical when there has to be ONE coin for storage of value. you have to separate.\n","\n","just imagine, how psycho would it be to say gold transactions are slower than banktransfers? people have to educate themselves about how to look at crypto economy. its nothing new, just digital! you find for everything the counterpart jn the real world. gold is THE only counterparty for btc.\n","\n","@@@and IF there is even slightly one other coin suitable for storage, it would be ***VERIUM***  https://twitter.com/VeriCoin/status/936716215640195072\n","\n","When you read about the vision of it you will understand why! Everyone of us ha a mobilephone! Decentralization to the sky!\n","\n","Hope this helps all to understand and differentiate between bitcoin and altcoins! Happy about your comments!\n","\n","\n","***Wikipedia definition of \"store of value\"*** from articles , translated ones, too:\n","\n","\"A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.  In principle, this could be true of any industrial commodity, but gold and precious metals are generally favored, because of their demand and rarity in nature, which reduces the risk of devaluation associated with increased production and supply.\"\n","\n","\"The purpose of national gold reserves used to be to cover gold currencies. Today, gold is kept as a national reserve during periods of crisis and as a risk compensation to fluctuations in the US dollar. \n","\n","***[MOST STRIKING POINT:]*** \"In addition, a high gold holdings also means high INDEPENDENCE, since gold can serve as a means of payment at ANY TIME.\"\n","\n","\n","***SUMMARIZED***\n","***just as in the real world there is the usecase of store of value which is largely fulfilled by gold (central banks hoarding it), there must be logically equivalent in the cryptoworld! Only one or two coins can fulfill this usecase, as in the real world there is also largely two gold or silver. In my opinion BTC is most suited for this usecase (and eventually Verium). it is one of most important usecases to have a longstanding stable economy. One should never compare btc with altcoins. because there is no other altcoin with this specific usecase  of value store (or more suitable from tech view of point than btc). Altcoins have other great innovative features and should be compared among altcoins.   PS: sure nobody says BTC has to have ONLY this usecase. but it is BEST suited for it. and crypto is in its infancies, i guess btc could be enriched in the future with other advantegous characteristics. you can have payments and store of value in ONE. you can store gold, but also pay with gold.***\n","2018-01-31 17:12:34\n","flair_s                              0\n","0
