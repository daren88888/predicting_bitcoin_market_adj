# Predictive analysis of Bitcoin price considering social sentiments.


* ABSTRACT

In this project report, we explore machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the Bitcoin
price. Bitcoin is leading cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization in digital
currencies. Predicting Bitcoin values may help understand and predict potential market
movement and future growth of the technology. Unlike (mostly) repeating phenomena like
weather, cryptocurrency values do not follow a repeating pattern and mere past value of Bitcoin
does not reveal any secret of future Bitcoin value. Humans follow general sentiments and
technical analysis to invest in the market. Hence considering people’s sentiment can give a good
degree of prediction. We focus on using the social sentiment as a feature to predict future Bitcoin
value. Google News and Reddit posts are considered to learn about people’s sentiment. We
conclude that social sentiment gives a good estimate of how future Bitcoin values may move.

Bitcoin has sparked a gigantic interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Since
the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency has gained the trust of the general population. Bitcoin
has remained in the highest market place of the cryptocurrency. As of this writing Bitcoin market
capitalization is more than 134 billion US dollars. Bitcoin gains this market value as there a
huge demand for this cryptocurrency. The demand for the cryptocurrency directly translates into
people’s trust in the Bitcoin and the underneath technology. Since people’s trust is involved in
the rise of the cryptocurrency market, the sentiment of the general population does make a huge
impact on the future of the cryptocurrency market capitalization. Hence, we use the sentiment of
people in an attempt to predict future Bitcoin prices. Google news is a nice source for collecting 
news posted by various journalists around the globe. Google News also provides the capability to
search the news based on selected keywords and its search tool also a feature of crawling the
news based on the date of the news release. While Google news gives opinions of the various
journalists we also focus on sentiments of the general population. www.Reddit.com (Reddit) is
also one the of most famous social platform where people can post anonymously. We also
consider the sentiment of messages posted on Reddit to predict the Bitcoin price movement.
Along with sentiments, we have included historical price and volume of Litecoin and Ethereum.
We have trained various machine learning models to learn about co-relation between all these
features and results are analyzed.
